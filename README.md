## What?
Webform to collect sign-up data for daily coding newsletter aimed at developers or future developers.

## Why?
So we can send them the newsletter and collect/analyse user information based on their input. For example, targeted campaigns based on gender or language, collect suggestions from free text box, birthday message.

## How
The users will quite probably be at a meetup or event, or will get to the form through a website link. They will often be using mobile phones. User experience will be enhanced with humour. Low number of fields. Thankyou message on submission. Asterix to indicate optional input. Responsive/mobile-first design. It will be a nice calming green, like a standard coffee cup.

## Stretch goals
* Creation of stylised banner with logo of coffee cup.
* Come up with snazzy tagline.
* Connect with mailchimp or other email service.
* Data validation of email address to avoid duplicate sign-ups on database.
