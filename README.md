Puns. Low number of fields. Thankyou message on submission. Asterix to indicate optional input. Responsive/mobile-first design.

* How will you make it pretty?

Nice calming green

* Try drawing out wireframes of your app, and form. It's okay to design parts of a page that won't function (e.g. menu buttons) as well as think about elements that might enhance your user's experience. Stay focused on the form, though! Try to think about how it might break or annoy a user, as well as thinking about all the different types of data that you might want to capture.
